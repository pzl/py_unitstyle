Simple Project Example
======================

This is a minimal use case for `unitstyle`. 

Your project code is in `code.py`. It is run as normal with `python code.py`.

You wrote unit tests for it, and put those in `tests/`. To run those tests, you created `test.py`. So, to run the tests on your project, you run `python test.py`.


`unitstyle.py` is only symlinked here to allow you to run `python test.py` without having `unitstyle` installed globally, but still have it import correctly.
